## **Problem**
Based on personal observations and feedback from fellow students, it is evident that the JavaScript branch possesses a strong foundation. However, to remain in sync with modern technologies and meet real-world demands, it requires a significant update. JavaScript consistently ranks among the most popular programming languages, indicating that a substantial number of students will likely encounter it in their professional careers.

Currently, the branch offers only one project(social-network), which employs a relatively modern tech stack and emphasizes real-world application. However, given that the branch aims to provide a comprehensive six-month front-end development program, it falls short when compared to a three-month course or bootcamp that covers multiple frameworks, libraries, bundlers, and supersets such as React, Vue, Angular, TypeScript, Webpack, and Babel.

Based on my personal experience during job hunting, I have observed that companies prefer junior developers with familiarity in these modern technologies over candidates who have primarily focused on building applications "the hard way" without exposure to these popular tools and frameworks.

## **Aim**
Consequently, my proposal aims to refine the JavaScript branch through restructuring that lifts some of the current restrictions and introduces additional projects. These new projects will enable students to gain hands-on experience with modern technologies, better preparing them for the competitive job market.

By incorporating a diverse range of projects that encompass the use of these modern tools, students will have the opportunity to explore and master the technologies currently in high demand. This approach will empower them to tackle real-world challenges more effectively, enhance their employability, and align their skillset with the expectations of prospective employers.
